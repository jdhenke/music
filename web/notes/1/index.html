    <h1>The Science of Sound</h1>
    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
	This page explains how the physical mechanics of sound work, how to
	mathematically describe important attributes of sound, and how our ears
	actually perceive those attributes. Understanding the connection
	between the mathematical concepts and the corresponding aspects of
	sound will be helpful because the mathematical concepts will be used to
	explain and manipulate music throughout this site. This page mentions
	but is not exclusive to musical notes, but instead describes sound in
	general, leaving the specifics of musical notes, including a more
	precise mathematical definition of waves, for the next page. After
	reading this page, you should have an understanding of what makes
	sounds soft or loud as well as low or high pitched.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Pressure</b> Is The Force Against A Surface</h2>
    <p>
	One example is pushing against a wall, your hand is applying a force
	against the parts of the wall it is touching, so that part of the wall
	is under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
	Another example that is closer to how hearing works is the pressure in
	a tire. The air inside the tire is pressing against the inner surface
	of the rubber of the tire, creating pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
	In the same way, air in the atmosphere is actually applying pressure to
	your eardrum.
    </p>

    <p>
	However, there is also air on the other side of the ear drum that is
	applying equal pressure, so your eardrum is not constantly bulging one
	way or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
	However, if the pressure from the outside of your ears increases, such
	as when scuba diving, or decreases, such as flying in an airplane, your
	ears may equalize and you may feel a “pop”, which is letting air in or
	out from behind your eardrum to equalize the pressure so that the
	sensation of pressing against your eardrums goes away.
    </p>
    <h2>
	<b>Pressure Waves</b> Create Moving Fluctuations In Pressure
    </h2>
    <p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave">Pressure Waves</a> are fluctuations in pressure that move through a medium.
    </p>
    <p>
	For example, holding a slinky with both hands and shaking one side will
	produce a movement through the slinky where the coils get closer and
	farther apart.
    </p>
    <p>
	In the same way, pressure waves can move through a gas or liquid, where
	the molecules get closer and farther apart.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Spherical_pressure_waves.gif">
    </p>
    <p>
	Pressure waves move at a constant speed which depends on what the wave
	is moving through.
    </p>
    <p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound">The speed of
	pressure waves moving through the air</a> is around 767mph, whereas
	<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/seismic-wave">seismic
	waves</a> through the earth can travel at more than ten times that
	speed.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Periodic Waves</b> Repeat At Some <b>Frequency</b> and Have an <b>Amplitude</b></h2>
    <p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function">Periodic
	waves</a> are waves that repeat the same pattern over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
	How long it takes to repeat themselves is their period, or inversely,
	how often they repeat themselves in a given amount of time is their
	frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
	For a periodic pressure wave, the maximum amount the pressure changes
	during each period is its amplitude.
    </p>

        <i>
	    If <code>x(t)</code> describes the pressure over time as a periodic
	    pressure wave comes through, then <b><code>A</code></b> describes
	    the <b>amplitude</b> and <code>T</code> describes the period,
	    making <b><code>1/T</code></b> the <b>frequency</b>.
        </i>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Sounds</b> Are Periodic Pressure Waves In The Air</h2>
    <p>
	Finally, sound itself can be described using the terminology that’s
	been developed so far, specifically, as <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound#Physics">periodic pressure
	waves that travel through the air</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
	This means that the source of the sound must be something that is
	repeatedly moving with some frequency, and displacing the air with some
	amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
	This could be the vibrating strings on a piano when it’s being played
	or your vibrating vocal chords when you are talking.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Ears Perceive Amplitude as <b>Loudness</b></h2>
    <p>
	The amplitude of the sound wave is perceived by your ears as its
	loudness.
    </p>
    <p>
	Sources that displace the air a larger amount create a louder sound.
    </p>
    <p>
	For example, if you gently pluck a guitar string so it only moves a
	small physical distance, the sound is quieter. Conversely, if you pluck
	it hard, the string moves a larger physical distance and the sound is
	louder.
    </p>
    <p>
	Most humans can hear sounds between 0 and 120-130 decibels (dB) and has
	to do with the ratio of the amplitude (how much the pressure changes
	during the wave) relative to the baseline pressure. <a
	href="http://www.cochlea.org/en/hear/human-auditory-range#:~:text=The%20human%20ear%20as%20a,irreversible%20damage%20above%20120%20dB.">Hearing
	damage can start around 90dB</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Ears Perceive Frequency As <b>Pitch</b></h2>
    <p>
	The frequency of the sound wave is perceived by your ears as its pitch.
	Sources that create a higher frequency sound high pitched, and sources
	with a lower frequency sound low pitched.
    </p>
    <p>
	For example, rumbling thunder has a low frequency while birds chirping
	have a high frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
	Most humans can hear frequencies between <a
	href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10924/#:~:text=Humans%20can%20detect%20sounds%20in,to%2015%E2%80%9317%20kHz.)">20Hz
	and 20,000Hz</a>. Hz means per second, so a periodic wave with a
	frequency of 1000Hz means the wave repeats itself 1000 times per
	second, or once every millisecond.
    </p>

        <summary>
	    If you were in a room with constant pressure twice that of sea
	    level, could you “hear” the higher pressure?
	</summary>

        <p>
	    <b>No!</b> If the pressure is not repeatedly changing, there’s no
	    frequency. If you haven’t equalized your ear, you might feel a
	    physical pressure in your ear, but the increased pressure is not
	    itself a sound.

	    Why do car sirens sound higher pitched coming towards you and lower
	    pitched going away from you?
	</summary>

        <p>
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">The Doppler
	    Effect</a> describes this phenomenon occurring because, as the
	    siren moves toward you, each successive wave starts a little bit
	    closer to you, making the waves closer together, so when they get
	    to you the wave is repeating with a higher frequency than if it was
	    standing still.
         </p>

        <p>
            Note: This does NOT happen because the waves themselves are traveling
            faster though. The speed of sound in a given medium is constant.

	If a plane going faster than the speed of sound is coming towards you,
	what does it sound like?
	</summary>

        <p>
	    <b>Nothing!</b> If it emitted a sound a mile away, the plane would
	    reach you before the sound it created there did, so while the plane
	    is still in front of you, it would be completely silent, always
	    ahead of the sound it produces.
        </p>
    </details>
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
	On this page, it was shown how sounds are really periodic pressure
	waves propagating through the air, which our eardrums interpret using
	two attributes of these waves. First, the amplitude of the wave, how
	much the wave temporarily changes the pressure, corresponds to how loud
	a sound is. Second, the frequency of the wave, how quickly the wave
	repeats itself, corresponds to a sound’s pitch.
