<h1>The Science of Sound</h1>
    <h2>How Sound Works</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Sounds</b> are actually pressure waves that your ears can detect.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pressure</b> can be thought of as how hard the air is pushing against your eardrum.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pressure Waves</b> can be thought of as ripples of slightly higher and lower pressure that move through the
        air.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your ears detect these <b>changes</b> in pressure, and more specifically, they are detecting:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>How often</i> the pressure is getting slightly higher or lower</li>
        <li><i>How much</i> higher or lower the pressure is changing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <i>How often</i> the pressure is changing is its <b>frequency</b>, usually measured in Hertz (Hz), which means
        "how many times in one second" the pressure is changing. Humans can hear sounds from 20Hz to 20,000Hz.
    </p>

    <p>
        In more familiar terms, the frequency of a sound is what makes it sound like a low or high note, or
        its <b>pitch</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Fast</i> frequencies, pressure changes that happen <i>more</i> often per second, sound high and squeaky.</li>
        <li><i>Slow</i> frequencies, pressure changes that happen <i>less</i> often per second, sound low and deep.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <i>How much</i> the pressure is changing is its <b>amplitude</b>, usually measured in decibels (dB), which
        indicates, relative to the normal pressure, how much the pressure is changing in each ripple. Humans can
        generally hear from 0dB to 150dB, with hearing damage possible starting at 80dB-85dB

    </p>

    <p>
        In more familiar terms, the amplitude of a sound is what makes it sound quiet or loud, or its
        <b>volume</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Large</i> amplitudes, <i>bigger</i> pressure changes, sound loud.</li>
        <li><i>Low</i> amplitudes, <i>smaller</i> pressure changes, sound quiet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Brain Teasers</h2>

    <p>
    <details>
        <summary>If you were in a room with the pressure twice as high as it is at sea level, what would it sound like?</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Nothing!</b> If the room is at a constant pressure then there's no <i>change</i> in pressure
            for your ear to detect, regardless of what that pressure is, so there is no sound.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>If you were on top of Mount Everest in a sound-proof tent, strumming the guitar, would it sound different than at sea level?</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Yes!</b> TBD why!
        </p>
    </details>

    <p>
    <details>
        <summary>Why do car sirens sound higher pitched coming towards you and lower pitched going away from you?</summary>

        <p>This is because the siren is coming toward you and the sound waves it produces are closer together in that direction.</p>
    </details>
    </p>

    <p>
    <details>
        <summary>If a plane going faster than the speed of sound is coming towards you what does it sound like?</summary>

        <p><b>Nothing!</b> Until it reaches you, that is.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>What can you say about the sound of a dog whistle and the hearing of a dog if you can't hear the whistle but the dog can?</summary>

        The frequency of the whistle, and therefore the dog's ability to hear, are both <b>higher than 20,000Hz</b>.
