    <h1>Notes As Sounds</h1>
    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
	Building off the last page’s explanation of how frequency and pitch are
	related, this page demonstrates how the shape of the wave matters as
	well by generating sounds using different waveforms, and then shows how
	a real piano sounds better than what these simple models produce,
	however the visualization of the wave is more complicated, leading to
	topic of the next page, which is how to deal with more complicated,
	realistic sounds like on a piano.
    </p>
    <h2>Notes Have A Specific Frequency</h2>
    <p>
	Remember that one characteristic of a sound is its pitch, and the
	frequency of its air pressure waves is what dictates the pitch. Each
	note is a different, consistent pitch, therefore every note has its
	own, specific frequency that corresponds to it.
    </p>

    <p>
	For example, if you play a key on the piano or one note on a guitar,
	the sound that note produces is characterized by a certain frequency.
    </p>

    <h2>The Shape of the Wave Matters</h2>
    <p>
	So if the pitch of a note comes from its frequency, what would
	generating a note sound like that simply alternated from low to high
	pressure at a given frequency?
    </p>


    <p>
	Visually, it would look like this, a type of wave called a <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a>:

    <p>
	As you can tell, this doesn't sound like any instrument, or even that
	pleasant.

    <p>
	Instead, here's a <a

	For comparison, here’s what the sound wave of a piano looks like?

	TODO: DRAW PIANO WAVE
    </p>


    <p>
	This is clearly much more complicated. You can listen to how this
	sounds here though to see that it does in fact sound pleasant and like
	a real piano:
    </p>


    <p>
	TODO: PLAY PIANO WAVE
    </p>


    <p>
	So what’s going on? 
    </p>

    <h2>A Better Visualization Is Needed To Explain Real Notes</h2>
    <p>
	Clearly, visualizing the pressure waves of these notes as pressure over
	time does not provide great intuition about what’s happening in the
	sound itself.
    </p>


    <p>
	How to do this will be the topic of the next page.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
	On this page, it was shown that the pitch of a note is characterized by
	its frequency, but the sound is also further shaped by the shape of the
	wave, with square waves having a harsh sound while a sin wave has a
	pure sound.  It was also shown that real sounds, like those of a piano,
	are not easy to visualized as simple variations in pressure over time.
	Therefore, a new visualization and understanding of what's happening is
	needed and will be developed on the next page.
