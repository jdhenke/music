# ðŸŽ¹ Joe's Music Project

This is my [pet project](https://github.com/jdhenke/music/discussions/2) to demonstrate an understanding of the basics of music theory **in code** as presented in each of the [12tone Building Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTOOWe_yLwY&list=PLMvVESrbjBWplAcg3pG0TesncGT7qvO06) videos.

- See this project's [website](https://joe-music.herokuapp.com/) to play with these concepts in an interactive way.
- See my [writing](https://github.com/jdhenke/music/discussions) about the project in this repo's discussions.
- See the [Developer Docs](DEVELOPER.md) if you want to try and play with the code yourself.

Cheers!
