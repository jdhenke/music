# ðŸŽ¹ Joe's Music Project

Hello! This is the code for [my music project](https://github.com/jdhenke/music/discussions/2).

Basically, I'm going through each of the [12tone Building Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMvVESrbjBWplAcg3pG0TesncGT7qvO06) videos on music theory, writing some code around the concepts, and building a [website](https://joesmusicproject.herokuapp.com/) as an interactive walk through of the content.

- See this project's [website](https://joesmusicproject.herokuapp.com/) to play with these concepts in an interactive way.
- See my [writing](https://github.com/jdhenke/music/discussions) about the project in this repo's discussions.
- See the [Developer Docs](DEVELOPER.md) if you want to try and play with the code yourself.

Cheers!
